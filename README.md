# Introduction

## About Me

I am **Aryan Gupta**.  
I was tasked to implement core functionalities of **NumPy** and **Pandas** libraries in C++. These libraries replicate the data manipulation and analysis capabilities provided in Python, tailored to the needs of C++ developers.

## Compilation and Running Instructions

The source code for the libraries resides in the `source` directory. To compile and execute, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Use the `Makefile` provided to build and run the project:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   This will compile the code in the `source` directory and execute the main program.

## Features of the Libraries

**NumPy Implementation:**

- Includes mathematical and statistical operations like sum, mean, and variance.
- Offers slicing, indexing, and reshaping of arrays.

**Pandas Implementation:**

- Mimics Python's DataFrame functionality.
- Allows column-wise operations.
- Provides methods for sorting, filtering, and custom transformations.
- Supports exporting and importing from CSV format.

**EDA Features:**

- Comprehensive statistical summary of datasets.
- Filtering and visualization of data.

## Project Objective

The primary goal was to bring the capabilities of popular Python data libraries like NumPy and Pandas to the C++ ecosystem, allowing developers to perform seamless EDA in C++.
