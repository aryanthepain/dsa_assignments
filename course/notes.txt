Array Creation and Manipulation:

array(): create array
zeros(): create array with all zeroes
ones(): create array with all ones
arange(): Create array with values in specified range.
linspace(): Create array with equally spaced values.
reshape(): Change array's shape without altering data.
flatten(): Convert multi-dimensional array to 1D.
concatenate(): Join multiple arrays along an axis.
split(): Split array into multiple sub-arrays.

Mathematical Operations:

add(): Element-wise addition of arrays.
subtract(): Element-wise subtraction of arrays.
multiply(): Element-wise multiplication of arrays.
divide(): Element-wise division of arrays.
power(): Raise array elements to a power.
dot(): Dot product of two arrays.
sum(): Sum of array elements.
mean(): Mean of array elements.
std(): Standard deviation of array elements.
var(): Variance of array elements.
cumsum(): Cumulative sum of array elements.
cumprod(): Cumulative product of array elements.
sin(): Sine of array elements.
cos(): Cosine of array elements.
exp(): Exponential of array elements.
log(): Natural logarithm of array elements.
max(): Returns the maximum value among the elements in the array.
min(): Returns the minimum value among the elements in the array.
slice(): Returns a new array containing elements from the original array starting from start to end.
unique(): Returns a new array containing only the unique values from the original array.
count(): Counts and returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the array.

Linear Algebra:

dot(): Dot product of two arrays.
matmul(): Matrix multiplication of two arrays.
transpose(): Transpose of an array (swap axes).
inverse(): Inverse of a matrix.
det(): Determinant of a matrix.
eig(): Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

Random Sampling:

random.rand(): Generate array of random numbers from a uniform distribution.
random.randint(): Generate random integers within a specified range.
random.shuffle(): Shuffle the elements of an array randomly.
random.choice(): Randomly select elements from an array with or without replacement.

Pandas Functionalities:
Data Structures:

DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

DataFrame Operations:

head(): Return the first n rows of the DataFrame.
tail(): Return the last n rows of the DataFrame.
shape: Return a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame.
columns: Return the column labels of the DataFrame.
index: Return the row labels of the DataFrame.
describe(): Generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
drop(): Remove rows or columns from the DataFrame.
merge(): Merge DataFrame objects with a database-style join.
concat(): Concatenate DataFrame objects along a particular axis.
groupby(): Group DataFrame using a mapper or by series of columns.

Data Selection and Indexing:

.loc: Access a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array.
.iloc: Access a group of rows and columns by integer position.
at(): Access a single value for a row/column label pair.
iat(): Access a single value for a row/column pair by integer position.

Extra functions:

read_csv: Read a comma-separated values (CSV) file into a DataFrame.
copy: Create a copy of the DataFrame or Series.
print: Display the content of the DataFrame or Series.
median: Calculate the median of the DataFrame or Series.
quartiles: Calculate the quartiles of the DataFrame or Series.
is.na: Detect missing values in the DataFrame or Series.
